</h1><div class="top"><p class="src"><a name="v:conclusions" class="def">conclusions</a> ::  a</p><div class="doc"><p>By formulating the third list homomorphism theorem in point-free,
 relational style, we have dualised the theorem to unfolds, as well as
 generalised the theorem to both folds and unfolds for trees. While
 the original theorem establishes a connection between insertion
 sort and merge sort, the dual theorem shows a similar connection
 between selection sort and quicksort. We have also derived an
 efficient parallel algorithm for scan based on unfolds. To the best
 of the authors' knowledge, while there have been many studies
 on parallel programming based on structural recursion, none have
 considered the dual -- list generation in the form of <em>unhom</em>.
</p><p>The theorem generalises nicely to trees: if a function processes
 or generates a tree both downwards and upwards, it may process or
 generate the tree from the middle. Finally, we have also presented
 an example that shows how a relational view may shed new light
 on an old topic by revealing its hidden symmetry. The authors
 believe that relational methods deserve to be appreciated more
 among functional programmers.
</p><p>As a remark, in practice, for both list and tree generation one
 might need different types of seeds for left vs. right or inwards vs. outwards
 unfolding. 
</p><p>That is, we have 
</p><pre>
        k = unfoldr g_fwd p . i_1 
          = unfoldl g_rev p . i_2
</pre><p>or 
</p><pre>
        k = unf_d   fs_d . i_1 
          = unf_u   fs_u . i_2
</pre><p>for some i_1 and i_2 that initialise the seeds. 
</p><p>This is also covered by Theorem 7. We leave it to the
 readers to work out the details.
