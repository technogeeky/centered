-- ^
-- By formulating the third list homomorphism theorem in point-free,
-- relational style, we have dualised the theorem to unfolds, as well as
-- generalised the theorem to both folds and unfolds for trees. While
-- the original theorem establishes a connection between insertion
-- sort and merge sort, the dual theorem shows a similar connection
-- between selection sort and quicksort. We have also derived an
-- efficient parallel algorithm for scan based on unfolds. To the best
-- of the authors' knowledge, while there have been many studies
-- on parallel programming based on structural recursion, none have
-- considered the dual -- list generation in the form of 'unhom'.
--
-- The theorem generalises nicely to trees: if a function processes
-- or generates a tree both downwards and upwards, it may process or
-- generate the tree from the middle. Finally, we have also presented
-- an example that shows how a relational view may shed new light
-- on an old topic by revealing its hidden symmetry. The authors
-- believe that relational methods deserve to be appreciated more
-- among functional programmers.


-- * Closing Remark
-- As a remark, in practice, for both list and tree generation one
-- might need different types of seeds for left vs. right or inwards vs. outwards
-- unfolding.

-- That is, we have
